Some Basics of Game Theory.

Q1.Let us suppose that you have 74 coins and you can pick minimum 2 coins and maximum 6 coins and There are two players A and B
how much coins should a pick at start to win the game.
	
Ans 1: You have to reduce 74 to multiple of (2+6) so A will reduce 74 to 72.Now its Finders winners means the player who plays
       last turn wins the match At each turn A will reduce the game to multiple of 8 to win the game at last suppose at last 
       the number will arrive at 8 now B will pick any thing between 2 and 6 coins a will pick the left over coin and wins the
       match.But if it would be a Keepers losers game than we have to reduce the number to multiple of 8 + x (Where x is equal to
       1<x<=a ).
   
   **************************** Composite Game / Grundy Number **************************************************************
Imp-> We will use sprague grundy theorem in that case in which we are not suppose to choose any no of coins we want we have a limit.
