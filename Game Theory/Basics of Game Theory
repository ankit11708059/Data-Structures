how much coins should a pick at start to win the game.
	
Ans 1: You have to reduce 74 to multiple of (2+6) so A will reduce 74 to 72.Now its Finders winners means the player who plays
       last turn wins the match At each turn A will reduce the game to multiple of 8 to win the game at last suppose at last 
       the number will arrive at 8 now B will pick any thing between 2 and 6 coins a will pick the left over coin and wins the
